# Fundamental Productivity Tools: Tmux and Midnight Commander

## Tmux
Tmux is one of the most useful utilities. It allows to run CLI commands in separate tabs and windows â€“ it is like a windows graphical user interface, *without* the graphical user interface. The power of this utility lies in simple creation of working desktops, inside a terminal.

With Tmux, you can run multiple commands at once in separate panes.

### Basic Shortcuts in Tmux
All shortcuts are preceded by <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> by default.
- zoom or unzoom a selected window pane, `z`
- create horizontal pane `"` , vertical `%`
- close selected pane `x`
- mark `m`
- context menu with right mouse button

- the touch should work on phone or tablet, in case you can not move with mouse between panes and control their size, use `tmux set -g mouse on`.  

### Scripting Tmux
You can easily create batch scripts, starting *tmux* with specific setups.

1. Create batch script, f.i. tmux-1, by running `touch tmux-1`.
2. Edit the file by nano or vim, f.i. `nano tmux-1`
```
#!/bin/sh
tmux new-session -d 'vim'
tmux split-window -v 'ipython'
tmux split-window -h
tmux new-window 'mutt'
tmux -2 attach-session -d
```
