# Why to Use Android Linux on the Road?
## Abstract

Using Linux on mobile device brings some limitations, but also many advantages. It is a great tool for data science education and opens an interesting options in other scientific branches.

## Learn Linux on the Go
- programming languages and scripts
- quantum information
- creating scientific log
- mobile scientific lab

## Use Features of Mobile Devices

- structure of mobile devices
- Android device as scientific tool

## Unrooted vs. Rooted Device, What Does It Even Mean?

Rooting gives user the full access control to the device. It usually means change of operating system or installation of software which is not supported on unrooted device. Rooting can result in void warranty and/or instability of hardware. Unrooted devices are genuine, with operating system and system software provided or supported by the manufacturer.
In our experiments, we will use unrooted devices exclusively.

## Developing and Testing Algorithms
- creating and deploying your own scripts

## Hardware and Software

Android device with at least 4GB RAM and 64GB storage space is recommended. The faster the processor (search "comparing mobile device processors") the better. Most tasks in this book should run perfectly well on older device.

All examples in this book are tested on Android 10 and 11.

### Can I Connect My Mobile Android Device to External Monitor or TV?

For direct connection with HDMI cable (or in this case, USB-C/HDMI reduction) you need a device, which supports Mobile High-Definition Link
(MHL). Most new phones and mobile devices do NOT support this (search "mhl compatible devices" online to check if your device comply).

### Desktop Experience With External Keyboard and Mouse
The easiest hardware solution to create a **desktop experience based on mobile phone or tablet** is to use Chromecast or Miracast device. Put your phone to charger, connect to casted wi-fi, and you are ready to go.

When you use Bluetooth keyboard (ideally combined with touchpad), together with  Bluetooth mouse (use rechargeable batteries, and use mouse without a need of USB dongle), you can even avoid unnecessary cables.

You can also use VNC Server to cast your session to desktop or laptop computer.
