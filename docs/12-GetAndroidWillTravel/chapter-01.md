- quantum information
- creating scientific log
- mobile scientific lab

## Use Features of Mobile Devices

- structure of mobile devices
- Android device as scientific tool

## Unrooted vs. Rooted Device, What Does It Even Mean?

Rooting gives user the full access control to the device. It usually means change of operating system or installation of software which is not supported on unrooted device. Rooting can result in void warranty and/or instability of hardware. Unrooted devices are genuine, with operating system and system software provided or supported by the manufacturer.
In our experiments, we will use unrooted devices exclusively.

## Developing Algorithms
- creating and deploying your own scripts
