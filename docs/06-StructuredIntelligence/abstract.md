# Structured Intelligence
## Abstract
Research on developing structures for information processing. Intelligence in machine and human. Social intelligence in nature. Quantum networks and hierarchical systems. Complex networks. Predictions, causality and correlations. Timescales and subjective evaluations.

## What's next?
- storing data and knowledge, inferential decisions
- active development of intelligent structures
- learning in machine and human, models and phenomenology
- virtual modeling of visual cortex for data analysis
- iterative design and evolutional systems
- symbolism, emblematics and data compression
- decision making in evolving environments
- dynamic experience: evolution, revolution, devolution
- quantitative and qualitative options for measurement of intelligence
- designing and conforming to mental models
- descent of natural algorithms

- Develoment notes for OR framework
- Link test web [official documentation](https://docusaurus.io/).
- Link directory test **[versioning](../tutorial-extras/manage-docs-versions.md)** and **[i18n](../tutorial-extras/translate-your-site.md)**.
